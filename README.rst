This module simplifies fitting a large number of (mostly) isolated spectral
lines to a spectrum. It uses `Sherpa <http://cxc.harvard.edu/sherpa/>`_ as a
fitting engine.

I developed it for astronomical spectra with emission lines on top of a thermal
continuum, but I hope that it will be useful more generally, too.
